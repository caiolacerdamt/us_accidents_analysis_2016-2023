## Project: US Accidents Analysis (2016-2023)

This project aims to study accidents in the USA to reinforce knowledge in data science. It addresses hypotheses such as:

- Annual and monthly accident trends.
- Locations with the highest incidence of accidents.
- Characteristics contributing to accidents.
- Machine learning model to predict accident severity.

### How to Use

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3u8QYzLjnEaSurtZfSAS_oh9AT2Mn8X/edit) and place it in the same directory as the .ipynb file. Make sure to keep the same filename.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook, use the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install jupyter
  ```

3. **Run the Notebook:**

    - Navigate to the directory where the project was downloaded and open the terminal.
    - Start Jupyter Notebook by typing the following command:
     
```bash
  jupyter notebook
```

4. **Open and Execute the Notebook:**

    - After starting Jupyter Notebook, your default browser will open.
    - Locate and open the project file (US_Accidents_Analysis_2016-2023.ipynb).
    - Now you can execute the notebook cells one by one by pressing Shift + Enter.
    - Following these instructions, you can explore and run the project in your own environment, analyzing accidents in the USA from 2016 to 2023 and experimenting with the proposed machine learning model.

### About the Project

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identification of trends and patterns in the data.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- Machine Learning Model (XGBoost): Using XGBoost to predict accident severity.


### Small Conclusion

- Accidents have been increasing every year, possibly due to the growth of the automotive industry.
- States with higher population density are more prone to have more accidents.
- Features like crossing, junction, and stop are present in the majority of accidents.
- It's possible to create a machine learning model to predict the severity of accidents, but it's not entirely accurate.
- Open to feedback and criticism.
